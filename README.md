An assignement for my Data Analytics class where I chose a topic of interest. Made a goal to further understand the interest. And then used a dataset and a couple 
graphs to draw a conclusion.

**Required to run** You will need to have python 3 and jupyter notebook installed, as well as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

**How To Install Python 3** To install python 3, you simply go to this website: https://www.python.org then you follow these steps:
  1) Click on the "Downloads" tab on the website. 
  2) There will be a popup that will contain a section called "Download for Windows" with a version number underneath it, select that button.
  3) This should immediately start the downloading.
  4) Once the download is complete, double click on the executable file.
  5) Select the "Add Python 'Version Number' to PATH. This will help with a lot of redundancy in the future.
  6) Select "Customize installation".
  7) Select pip and any other features you desire and then select "next".
  8) Make sure to select "install for all users" (so you don't have to do this again) and select "Add Python to environment variables".
  9) (You can customize the location the Python is installed on, but you don't have to). Select install.
  10) to check that your python has installed successfully, you can go to your command terminal and type in "python --version" or "py --version".
  11) to check that your pip is installed and what version it is, you can type in the command "-m pip --version" in your command terminal as well.

**How to install numpy** Make sure you have python and pip installed before doing this
  1) in the command terminal, type in "py -m pip install numpy" and press enter. This should start an installation.
  2) if your pip needs to be upgraded after download type in the command "-m pip install --upgrade" to update your pip version.

**How to install pandas** Make sure you have python and pip installed before doing this
  1) in the command terminal, type in "py -m pip install pandas" and press enter. This should start an installation.
